#Ripple lib scripts

A couple of example scripts that use [ripple-lib](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib)

### Install
install `ripple-lib` through npm:
`npm install ripple-lib`

you can also use bower to install `ripple-lib`, but in that case you would have to update your dependency to `ripple`
```shell
bower install ripple
```

### Run

Run any script using node, e.g.:

```shell
node get_balances.js
```
